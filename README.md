# About Culerify
Culerify is a web app, where you can add, update or delete football players from the famous club [FC Barcelona](https://www.fcbarcelona.com/en/).
You can add any player of your liking, (maybe the one you dream to become a Culer one day). :)

## Additional info
With this project I'd like to demonstrate what I've learned in Ruby and Ruby on Rails so far.

### Prerequisities

* Configuration

* Database creation
